# Forecasting

This repository presents forecasting projects focused on predicting trends and future values using statistical and machine learning models. It demonstrates end-to-end analytics workflows—encompassing data preparation, modeling, and results evaluation—relevant for business, finance, or academic forecasting challenges.

## Project Highlights

**Time Series Forecasting – Academic Project**  
- Developed and compared models to predict future values from time series data.  
- Implemented techniques such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and machine learning approaches using Python or R.  
- Highlighted model performance using visualisations and metrics including MAE, RMSE, and forecast accuracy.

## Features

1. **Data Preparation:** Import, clean, and transform time series datasets.
2. **Visual Exploration:** Reveal patterns, seasonality, and trends through plots and summary statistics.
3. **Forecasting Models:** Build and evaluate models (ARIMA, ETS, or machine learning-based).
4. **Model Comparison:** Assess and compare models using relevant error metrics.
5. **Results Visualisation:** Plot forecasts against actuals for interpretation and presentation.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)  
  *or*  
- R (tidyverse, forecast, ggplot2)
